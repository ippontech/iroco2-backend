# Validate hexagonal architecture

## Context and Problem Statement

Nothing checks that hexagonal architecture is respected.

## Considered Options

* A technical leader has to check new codes
* Add new architectural unit tests

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Add new architectural unit tests", because a technical leader is not always available.

### Consequences

* Good, because developers can check the rules and the application keeps consistency.
